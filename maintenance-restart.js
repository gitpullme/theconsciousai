ðŸ”„ Database Updates Complete ðŸ”„
------------------------------------------

Important: We've made changes to several API endpoints to fix the "Failed to fetch report details" error:

1. Fixed API routes to use the correct Prisma client implementation
2. Added more detailed error handling and logging
3. Updated permissions to include ADMIN role access
4. Fixed ETag generation to work with the existing database schema
5. Implemented fallback mechanism to try both API endpoints

To apply these changes, please restart your Next.js development server:

1. Stop the current server (Press Ctrl+C in your terminal)
2. Restart the server with: npm run dev

After restart, the report details should load correctly.
